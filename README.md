# Iora

**Iora** is a modern **C++17 single-header microservice foundation library** designed for lightweight, readable, and modular code. It provides components for HTTP services, webhook handling, shell execution, configuration, caching, and pluggable state storage ‚Äî making it a solid base for event-driven, embedded, or general-purpose applications.

---

## üê¶ What's In The Name?

**Iora** is named after the *Common Iora*, a small but remarkably agile songbird native to Southeast Asia. Known for its vibrant presence and melodic call, the iora thrives in diverse environments ‚Äî from dense forests to open gardens.

The same philosophy inspired this library:
- üå± **Lightweight** in footprint and dependencies  
- üß© **Modular** in structure  
- ‚ö° **Responsive** by design ‚Äî ideal for building asynchronous and event-driven systems

The name is also a **recursive acronym**:

> **Iora Orchestrates Routing Asynchronously**

While originally built to support projects in AI and VoIP, `iora` is designed to be **general-purpose** ‚Äî useful for any C++17 application where modularity, clarity, and responsiveness matter. Like the bird it‚Äôs named after, `iora` is small, adaptable, and always ready to respond.

## ‚ú® Features

- **http::HttpClient** ‚Äì Wraps `cpr` to call JSON REST APIs.
- **http::WebhookServer** ‚Äì Wraps `cpp-httplib` to handle POST webhooks.
- **shell::ShellRunner** ‚Äì Executes Linux shell commands and captures stdout.
- **state::StateStore** ‚Äì Abstract KV store with disk-backed implementation using `nlohmann::json`.
- **config::ConfigLoader** ‚Äì Loads TOML files using `toml++`.
- **util::CliParser** ‚Äì Parses key:value or JSON CLI output.
- **util::ExpiringCache<K,V>** ‚Äì TTL-based thread-safe cache.
- **util::CaselessMap** ‚Äì Case-insensitive `unordered_map`.
- **log::Logger** ‚Äì Static class with levels (debug/info/warn/error).

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd iora
   ```

2. Configure the project:
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build build
   ```

---

## ‚úÖ Run Tests

1. Build the project (if not already built):
   ```bash
   make
   ```

2. Run all tests:
   ```bash
   make check
   ```

This will build and run the full test suite. No ctest integration is required.

## üöÄ Sample Microservice Application

A sample microservice is available under `sample/`, demonstrating:

- **HttpClient** for making HTTP requests  
- **WebhookServer** for receiving webhooks  
- **ShellRunner** for executing shell commands  
- **StateStore** for managing key-value state  
- **ExpiringCache** for TTL-based caching  
- **Logger** for structured logging

### Build and Run

1. Build the sample application:
   ```bash
   cmake --build build --target microservice_example
   ```

2. Run it:
   ```bash
   ./build/sample/microservice_example
   ```

## üîó Linking to Iora

You can link to the Iora library using CMake, Autoconf, or a manual Makefile.

### CMake (Subdirectory)

```cmake
add_subdirectory(path/to/iora)
target_link_libraries(your_project PRIVATE iora_lib)
```

### CMake (FetchContent)

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    iora
    GIT_REPOSITORY <repository-url>
    GIT_TAG <commit-or-tag>
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(iora)
target_link_libraries(your_project PRIVATE iora_lib)
```

### Autoconf (`configure.ac`)

```m4
AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])
AC_OUTPUT
```

In your `Makefile.am`:

```makefile
your_project_LDADD = -Lpath/to/iora/build -liora_lib -lcpr -lhttplib -lnlohmann_json
your_project_CPPFLAGS = -Ipath/to/iora/include
```

### Manual Makefile

```makefile
CXXFLAGS += -Ipath/to/iora/include
LDFLAGS += -Lpath/to/iora/build
LDLIBS += -liora_lib -lcpr -lhttplib -lnlohmann_json
```

Compile and link:

```bash
g++ -o your_project your_project.cpp $(CXXFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS)
```

## üßÆ Optional: Enable tiktoken-cpp for Tokenizer

To use exact token counting via `tiktoken-cpp`:

### Install tiktoken-cpp

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gh-markt/tiktoken.git
cd tiktoken
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

### CMake Auto-detection

- If `tiktoken-cpp` is installed system-wide, it will be auto-linked.
- Otherwise, the fallback estimator will be used.
- Detected builds define the `IORA_USE_TIKTOKEN` macro.
